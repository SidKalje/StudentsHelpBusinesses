## Inspiration

As a high schooler who has struggled finding internships with startups, and who has personally seen small businesses shut down because of their inability to pay to manage aspects of their business, I developed this solution to hit two birds with one stone.

## What it does

StudentsHelpBusinesses is a community platform that allows highschoolers to check out internship opportunities created by small businesses.

## How we built it

To build this, I used firebase for the backend, and react.js and React-bootstrap for the front-end.

## Challenges we ran into

Managing the backend database was quite challenging, as I have never used it before

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Im proud of being able to learn so much in such a short time.

## What we learned

With this project, I learned to connect a react.js frontend to a express js backend, and also use firebase and cloud firestore for their authentication and database capabilities. I also learned how to send email notifications, and attach attachments to them. I learned a lot about state management in react too, and different hooks in react.

## What's next for StudentsHelpBusinesses
Next, I would like to integrate direct messaging between businesses and students, and also have more options for the user's profile, such as more detailed information about them.

To run:

Fork the repo and clone it. Initialize npm with the command:

npm init

Then, install vite, react-boostrap, and firebase with npm. Navigate to the server directory, and install nodemailer, cors, body-parser, and express.

In the main directory, start the project with npm run dev. Navigate to the server directory, and start the server with npm run dev.
