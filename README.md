## Inspiration

As a high schooler who has struggled finding internships with startups, and who has personally seen small businesses shut down because of their inability to pay to manage aspects of their business, I developed this solution to hit two birds with one stone.

## What it does

StudentsHelpBusinesses is a community platform that allows highschoolers to check out internship opportunities created by small businesses.

## How we built it

To build this, I used firebase for the backend, and react.js and React-bootstrap for the front-end.

## Challenges we ran into

Managing the backend database was quite challenging, as I have never used it before

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Im proud of being able to learn so much in such a short time.

## What we learned

Before this project, I had little to no experience with react.js, and had only coded in python before. This project allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and develop an application on my own.

## What's next for StudentsHelpBusinesses

In the future, I would like to add app-to-user notifications, as well as an option to apply directly through the app.
